# 🌰 topsailcashew's Stomping Grounds

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website.

It's a place to showcase my work, my skills, and my questionable sense of humor. Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, it's a living example of my coding style (and my coffee consumption).

Feel free to browse the code, but please don't ask me to fix your printer.
