## 🏴‍☠️ Welcome to topsailcashew  
This site has **nothing** to do with boats.  
It also has **nothing** to do with nuts.  
Honestly, I don’t know why you’re here…  
…but since you are, please admire my work 👇

## 🛠️ Recent Creations  
Things I built instead of going to bed like a normal human.

### 🚀 Project 1  
It’s an e-commerce homepage. Does it sell anything?  
Emotionally, yes.  
Technically, also yes.

**Tech:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
[**Gaze Upon It**](#)

### 🧠 Project 2  
A task management dashboard.  
Does it help me manage my tasks?  
Absolutely not.  
But it looks fantastic.

**Tech:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
[**Witness the Chaos**](#)

### 🧱 Project 3  
A drag-and-drop website builder.  
So easy, even my houseplants could use it.  
(And they’re divas.)

**Tech:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
[**Click At Your Own Risk**](#)

## 🧰 My Toolbox  
A list of technologies I use to build things nobody asked for.

### Languages I Argue With Daily  
- JavaScript  
- TypeScript (JavaScript but with rules)  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (why won’t you center???)  
- Python  
- SQL  

### Frameworks & Libraries  
The reason I have trust issues:  
- React  
- Next.js  
- Node.js  
- Express  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Redux (send help)

### Databases & Tools  
Where I store all my regrets:  
- PostgreSQL  
- MongoDB  
- Firebase  
- Docker (the gym membership of dev tools — everyone has it, few use it)  
- Git & GitHub  
- Vite (very fast, very polite)

### Design  
Making things pretty so no one notices the bugs.  
- Figma  
- Responsive Design  
- UI/UX Principles  
- Prototyping

## 🤪 Quirks & Curiosities  
Because you're not hiring a robot. Probably.

- I’ve watched “The Office” so many times I answer emails like Michael Scott.  
- Pineapple on pizza? Yes. Fight me.  
- My plants judge me. I feel it.  
- I can solve a Rubik’s Cube in under a minute. Faster if threatened.  
- I own more vintage keyboards than friends.  
- I built a robot that serves butter. No follow-up questions.  
- My favorite part of coding is deleting 400 lines and watching everything still work.
