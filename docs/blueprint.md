## Style Guidelines:

- Primary background: White (#FFFFFF) to create a stark canvas.
- Text color: Pure black (#000000) for high contrast.
- Accents: Use a grayscale palette for borders, fills, and UI elements.
- Headers: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif with a very bold weight (700-900).
- Body text: 'Inter' for a clean and readable appearance.  
- Use a clean, grid-based layout with ample white space and generous card-based content blocks with thick black borders.
- Incorporate intentional overlapping/staggered elements for added visual interest, especially in the gallery sections.
- Arrow icons for links/navigation to fit the theme.
- Hover states that maintain the stark, high-contrast aesthetic without added color.
